       " 'The Unions also contend that on 3 November 2008, approximately seven months after the Agreement was entered into, John Holland put a proposal to their employees at the X25 and X50 work sites to vary the Agreement so as to, among other things, delete the existing Appendix 1 described as \"Definition of Project\" and bearing the subheading \"The Scope of Works for X30 includes\", and substitute a new Appendix 1 defining the project under a subheading \"The Scope of Works for X50 includes the following\" with a new textual description of the project works.',\n",

'As Brennan CJ and McHugh J observed in IW v City of Perth [1997] HCA 30 ; [(1997) 191 CLR 1 , 12] such statements should be understood by reference to other provisions contained in the legislation.', 'Just as it makes no sense to interpret a provision without regard to the rest of the enactment, it is sometimes apparent that a general statement of purpose must be tempered by the contents of other provisions in the enactment.', 'In other words, like any other provision in legislation, a purpose or objects clause must be interpreted in its context.', 'In these instances the challenge is to deduce the relevant purpose of the provision being interpreted from its context, using that term in its widest sense, and without an explicit starting-point.', \"(2) The task is informed by the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth), ss 15AA , 15AB and equivalent provisions, together with the statements of principle identified as the 'modern approach to statutory interpretation' in CIC Insurance .\", '(3) This means that both the underlying purpose or object and the context are to be considered initially, rather than after it has been concluded that the provision in question is ambiguous or unclear.', '(4) A statement of purpose or object, as with any other provision contained in legislation, is to be interpreted in its context.', 'NOPSA regulates the health and safety provisions of the Offshore Petroleum Act 2006 in Commonwealth waters and the Western Australian Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act of 1982 in designated coastal waters.', \"In considering specifically the regulatory regime from the State's perspective, the provisions of the 1969 State Act involved:\", \"The object of the 1969 State Act, apparent from its long title, is to make provision 'relating to the construction, operation and maintenance of pipelines for the conveyance of petroleum and for purposes connected therewith'.\", 'Part V contains miscellaneous provisions including practices of which judicial notice shall be taken, the power of the Minister to delegate powers and functions, the appointment of inspectors and the powers of inspectors, the creation of certain offences and the power to make regulations.', 'By s 21 of the 1969 State Act, there is provision in general terms for the State Minister to give a direction to a person requiring the pipeline operator to carry the gas of or for a third party.', 'The Minister has the power (s 24 of the 1969 State Act) to cancel a licence where a licensee has not complied with the conditions to which the licence is subject or has not complied with a provision of the Act or the Regulations or has not paid the relevant fees.', 'This includes, as the State argues the provision of a report to the Commonwealth so that the State and Commonwealth can work towards a common goal, considering that in many instances (such as the present), the pipeline is the same pipeline or pipelines travelling over both State and Commonwealth controlled land or sea.', 'The State submits that the purposes of the 1969 State Act do not necessarily exclude provision of information obtained under s 63 of that Act to the Commonwealth.', 'There is provision for delegation of the functions of a joint authority in s 66 to two persons, one of whom is a Commonwealth employee and the other an employee of the State.', 'Each of the respondents has also pointed to the fact that there are provisions for licensees to provide Safety Cases.', 'Similarly, under the Petroleum Submerged Lands Pipelines Regulations of 2007 (regs 23 and 44) there is provision for the submission of a pipeline management plan.', 'The State argues that provision of the documents to the Panel for both or all purposes is a purpose of the 1969 State Act.', 'Again, this may be so, but the further question must be how such experts are briefed and what is the ambit of the role of such experts?The Panel contends that the power to requisition documents under s 63 in aid of the purposes of the legislation entails also the power to have the information subjected to expert analysis and advice by reason of the provisions of s 50 of the Interpretation Act 1984 (WA).', 'But this latter step may be taken only where in so doing there is effected no change to the substantial purpose and effect of the impugned provision, and, in particular, there is not left substantially a different law as to the subject matter dealt with from what it would otherwise be (328).', 'In that statutory context the State argues that there is no basis for implying in the 1969 State Act any restriction on the provision of documents obtained under s 63 of that Act to the State Minister or his Department.', 'That principle was applied by a Full Court of this Court in Darling Harbourside (Sydney) Pty Ltd v Sanirise Pty Ltd (unreported, Beaumont, Carr, Sackville JJ, 17 May 1996) to an order for the provision of security for costs.', 'The Full Court set aside an order varying an order for the provision of security upon the basis that there had been no material change in circumstances established so as to warrant a variation of the original order.', 'The fact remains, however, and is readily acknowledged by the Appellant, that she is in no better position today than she was on 4 April 2008 to meet any order requiring the provision of security.', \"b) whether the respondents are entitled to rely upon the provisions of Pt IVAA of the Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic) ('the Wrongs Act ');\", '8 It was contended by the respondents that there is a relevant distinction between the provisions of the Trade Practices Act referred to by the court in I & L Securities [2002] HCA 41 ; 210 CLR 109 and the various provisions that are now relied upon by the applicant in this matter, so that the plea of contributing fault could be maintained, or at least was not clearly untenable.', \"In particular, it follows from the decision in Henville v Walker that there is nothing in s 82(1) , in other provisions of the Act, or in the policy of the Act, to suggest that a claimant's carelessness may be taken into account to reduce the amount of the loss or damage which the claimant is entitled to recover under s 82(1).\", 'Moreover, relief under s 82 is available not only for breaches of s 52 but for breaches of other provisions in Pt V as well as those in Pt IV of the Act and Pts IVA , IVB and s 51AC after the amendments.', 'The reasoning adopted by Williams J would be likely to lead to inconsistencies in applying s 82 across such a broad spectrum of regulatory provisions.', \"13 It is to be observed that the Commonwealth Parliament has introduced contributing fault provisions focusing on the conduct of an applicant in the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (' Corporations Act ') that would, if here applicable, found a basis for a contributing fault plea: see eg s 1041I(1B).\", 'However, Parliament has not extended those provisions to cover ss 945A and 947C (2)(e) of the amended Corporations Act (which are the corresponding provisions to ss 851 and 849 respectively of the old Corporations Act ) or to cover s 1012A of the amended Corporations Act .', 'In respect of ss 851 and 849 of the old Corporations Act and s 1012A of the amended Corporations Act it was contended that the position has been maintained by the subsequent legislative changes, whereas the introduction of an express provision allowing for contributing fault in s 12GF of the new ASIC Act showed (it was contended) that it was not envisaged such a plea of contributing fault was available under s 12DB of the ASIC Act.', 'In any event, it may not be appropriate to interpret the applicable legislation by reference to amending provisions: see generally Pearce & Geddes, Statutory Interpretation in Australia (6 th ed, 2006) p 97 et seq.', '18 There are no proportionate liability provisions in the old Corporations Act .', \"Proportionate liability provisions were introduced into the amended Corporations Act by the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program (Audit Reform and Corporate Disclosure) Act 2004 (Cth) ('CLERP Act'), Sch 3(4), which commenced on 26 July 2004: see s 2(1) of the CLERP Act.\", 'Accordingly, there is no provision of the old Corporations Act or the amended Corporations Act which applies a proportionate liability regime to the causes of action pleaded by the applicant.', '19 The proportionate liability provisions in subdiv GA of Div 2 of Pt 2 of the ASIC Act were introduced by Sch 3(2) of the CLERP Act, and apply to claims for damages under s 12GF for conduct done in contravention of s 12DA.', '20 Therefore, the respondents must and do rely upon the proportionate liability provisions of Pt IVAA of the Wrongs Act .', '24 It was argued by the respondents that just as other provisions of the Wrongs Act could apply based upon the operation of s 79 , there was no reason to form a different view in relation to Pt IVAA , and reliance was placed upon the authority of Bialkower v Acohs Pty Ltd (1998) 83 FCR 1.', '25 It is therefore necessary to consider the specific provisions of Pt IVAA relied upon by the respondents.', 'In any event, the Commonwealth Legislation may fall within the \"or otherwise\" part of the provision if a restrictive approach was to be taken to the term \"statute\" as referring only to an enactment of the Victorian Parliament.', '29 As the respondents observed, in drafting the provisions of Pt VIAA of the Wrongs Act , the legislature deliberately chose to define \"apportionable claim\" by reference to an action for damages arising from a failure to take reasonable care.', 'The provisions do not require that the claim itself be a claim in negligence or for a breach of duty --- it only requires that the claim arise from a failure to take reasonable care.', 'In my view, the operation of the Commonwealth Legislation would so reduce the ambit of Pt IVAA of the Wrongs Act that the provisions of the Commonwealth Legislation are irreconcilable with it: Northern Territory v GPAO [1999] HCA 8 ; (1999) 196 CLR 553 at [78] to [83] per Gleeson CJ and Gummow J, and at [135] per Gaudron J; Austral Pacific Group Ltd v Airservices Australia [2000] HCA 39 ; (2000) 203 CLR 136 at [17] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ, at [53] per McHugh J, and at [106] per Callinan J; Macleod v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2002] HCA 37 ; (2002) 211 CLR 287 at [22] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ.', '35 In support of the contention of the respondents that the provisions of Pt IVAA of the Wrongs Act should be seen as complementary, reliance was placed upon s 5E(1) and 5E (4) of the Corporations Act .', '\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 At all material times the loan to SCD was not recoverable and a provision for the non-recoverability of the loan was required in the accounts of York Street.', 'The failure to make a provision in the accounts of York Street was an irregularity such that the accounts of York Street did not show a true and fair view.', 'There is no evidence to show the timing of insolvency of York Street or Market Street prior to the appointment of liquidators or when certain provisions should have been made in the relevant financial reports.', '\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \"If I determine that, on a prima facie basis, there are reasons to believe the financial reports of [York Street] and [Market Street] do not disclose a true and fair view of the financial position of what audit issues, in my opinion, appear relevant in considering the financial position of the companies: for instance, is there an issue as to whether the balance sheets of [York Street] and [Market Street] should have included a provision for doubt as to the recoverability of the loans to, respectively, Scots Church Development Ltd and 60 Market Street Trust\" ; and', \"(ii) identified that at some stage in the period between the provision of an information memorandum in 2003 and the liquidator's reports of 30 June 2005, the loan owed to [York Street] by SCDL became uncollectible (para 6.\", 'In so concluding I have regard to the necessarily provisional basis upon which the appointments were made.', '(2B) Subsection (2A) is to avoid doubt, is not to limit the generality of anything in subsection (1) and is not to affect by implication the interpretation of any other provision of this Act.', \"It is unnecessary to set out here the terms of those provisions as, in my opinion, they are not applicable in the present case which must be concerned with Mr Carey's compliance with the Court orders made on 20 April 2006 and whether the Court should exercise its general powers under s 23 of the Federal Court Act requiring his oral examination to ensure compliance or to give proper effect to the Court's orders.\", \"18 The provisional character of the judgments upon which the orders for the appointment of the receivers were based informs consideration of the question whether the receivers' costs of discharging their functions under those orders should be borne by the defendants.\", 'In Corporate Affairs Commission v Smithson (1984) 3 NSWLR 547, Waddell J said of the like provisions of s 573 of the Companies (New South Wales) Code (at 553):', 'Absent any express power in the Corporations Act the relevant provision can be found in s 23 of the Federal Court Act or in the implied incidental power --- Jackson v Sterling Industries Ltd [1987] HCA 23 ; (1987) 162 CLR 612.', 'While there are serious concerns about the conduct of the defendants, these are based on provisional judgments about the facts.', '31 Food and Household provisions (part children) 528.'] 37\n"

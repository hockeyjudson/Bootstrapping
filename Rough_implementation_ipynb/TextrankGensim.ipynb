       "'\\xef\\xbb\\xbfThis unfair labor practice case is before the Authority on exceptions to the attached decision of the Administrative Law Judge (Judge) filed by the General Counsel (GC).The complaint alleges that the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute) by ordering the removal of two notices posted by the Charging Party, American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 900, (AFGE Local 900 or the Union) on the electronic bulletin board, which is maintained by the Respondent.\\nUpon consideration of the Judge&apos;s decision and the entire record, we adopt the Judge&apos;s findings, conclusions, and recommended Order only to the extent consistent with this decision. We find that one allegation of the complaint should be dismissed, for the reasons explained herein. We further find that a second allegation of the complaint, as described below, must be remanded to the Judge.II. Background\\nAFGE Local 900 represents a unit of approximately 1,100 employees of the Respondent, including employees of the U.S. Army Reserve Personnel Command (Command). The Command has an automated mail system, which includes e-mail and a number of electronic bulletin boards, including one for the Union. Mary Cooper, the Union&apos;s president, can post messages to the bulletin board. However, her practice has been to send a typed message to the Centralized Customer Agency (CCA), a part of Respondent&apos;s Information Support Activity, which actually does the posting. Until the events in this case in 1998, posted items would remain unless or until the Union requested they be removed.\\nRespondent&apos;s commander, Col. Conway, issued a policy directive on April 15, 1997, providing in pertinent part:d. E-mail shall not be used for:. . . .(7) Receiving, producing or sending annoying, harassing, lewd or offensive material.Respondent&apos;s Exh. 1 at 3.\\nIn mid-January, 1998, the Union made the following request concerning the collective bargaining agreement (CBA), which expired on January 1, 1998: It has been brought to the attention of the Union that your subordinates are still utilizing the guidelines of this agreement. The Union requests all actions as it pertains to the Agreement of the staffing plan cease until negotiations are complete.General Counsel&apos;s Exh. 2.\\nBy letter dated January 26, 1998, Col. Timothy W. Cannon, Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, Administration and Logistics, replied to the Union&apos;s request to bargain on the expired CBA. The reply noted that 37 employees had been scheduled to be promoted to grade GS-5 on January 18, 1998, as part of the Staffing Plan in effect until January 1, 1998. The letter stated that these promotions would be held in abeyance until completion of the requested negotiations, and that Respondent also would withdraw announcements for seven GS-7 positions, which would not be reannounced. The letter continued:I truly hope you understand the consequences that your request will have on the bargaining unit employees that you represent. First and foremost, your request will put a hold on 37 . . . promotions. . . . In order for these employees to receive their scheduled promotion pay beginning January 18, 1998, the Union&apos;s requested negotiations must be concluded January 28, 1998.General Counsel&apos;s Exh. 3 at 1-2, Judge&apos;s decision at 4.\\nEmployees obtained a copy of this letter, initialed by Cooper indicating that she received it on January 27, 1998. In the words of the Judge, Ms. Cooper \"retaliated\" on January 29, 1998, Judge&apos;s Decision at 4, with a notice to all unit employees posted on the electronic bulletin board. The notice provides, in part, as follows:On January 28, 1998, Tim \"LOOSE\" Cannon sent a letter to the Union President (SEE ATTACHED), stating that per the Union&apos;s request, he&apos;s holding all promotions until negotiations are complete.He purposely gives the impression that the Union asked to stop promotions. . . . Tim \"LOOSE\" Cannon issued copies of his letter and the Union&apos;s request to negotiate to management and employees; thereby, attempting to BUST UP THE UNION.Tim \"LOOSE\" Cannon sent me a letter via cc:mail &lsqb;e-mail&rsqb; stating that Management will proceed with the promotions of the GS-5&apos;s. He further stated that if the Union disagreed with the promotions, we could take appropriate actions. . . .General Counsel&apos;s Exh. 5 at 1, Judge&apos;s decision at 4-5.\\nThe Union&apos;s message was removed from the electronic bulletin board by management late in the day on January 29, the same day it was posted. When Cooper learned of this, she re-posted it, on February 2. This latter message, too, was removed, on February 2. On that same date, Maj. David Mingo of the Information Support Activity, which supports Respondent, sent a message to the Union, entitled \"AFGE 900 Message Screening,\" which stated:1. 29 January 1800, MAJ Boyd Collins &lsqb;public affairs officer for Respondent&rsqb; . . . asked that a derogatory message be removed from AFGE&apos;s Bulletin Board. I removed the message.2. I told him I would have my staff forward AFGE messages to me before posting them to the bulletin board. I neglected to inform my staff of this new requirement. . . Today Ms&lsqb;.&rsqb; Price reminded me of my commitment to MAJ Collins, and asked me to remove another derogatory message from the AFGE bulletin board.3. As of today myself or MSG Hill will review all AFGE messages prior to posting.General Counsel&apos;s Exh. 7, Judge&apos;s decision at 5-6.\\nThe Union filed a grievance, dated February 5, 1998, which states, in pertinent part:Union Grievance RE: Censorship of the Union&apos;s Electronic Bulletin BoardDear Ms. Calloway:The Union was informed &lsqb;on&rsqb; February 3, 1998 that the Agency will censor it&apos;s &lsqb;sic&rsqb; Electronic Bulletin Board and remove whatever they deem necessary. This is in violation of Article XIII of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. . . .Respondent&apos;s Exh. 2. Cooper testified that she later determined that the CBA does not contain anything about electronic bulletin boards. Tr. at 40. n2\\nn2\\nn2 The CBA is not in evidence.\\nThe Union filed the following unfair labor practice charge on March 6, 1998:On February 3, 1998 the Agency unilaterally changed a past practice without notifying this Union.Specifically, the Agency instructed CCA to screen all Union messages on the AFGE Bulletin ccmail account. The AFGE Bulletin &lsqb;board&rsqb; has NEVER been screened before. And the Union was not notified nor provided an opportunity to bargain.General Counsel&apos;s Exh. 1(a).\\nOn September 20, 1998, the Union filed an amended charge, which reads as follows:On February 3, 1998 the Agency unilaterally changed a &lsqb;past&rsqb; practice without notifying this Union.Specifically, the Agency instructed the Centralized Communications Agency (CCA) to screen all Union messages on the AFGE Bulletin cc mail account and to remove two messages from the AFGE electronic \"bulletin board\". The AFGE Bulletin has NEVER been screened or messages on it removed before. And the Union was not notified nor provided an opportunity to bargain.General Counsel&apos;s Exh. 1(b).\\nOn February 2, 1998, the same day that the \"loose Cannon\" memo was re-posted (and removed), the Union posted another memo to its electronic bulletin board, this one concerning a Partnership Council issue. It began, \"Well, once again the Agency officials have conspired to &apos;UNION BUSTING.&apos;\" General Counsel&apos;s Exh. 9. The posting also contained the text of a grievance filed by the Union that day, alleging violations of a specific article of the CBA that deals with partnership. n3 It is undisputed that the Respondent removed this message on February 2.\\nn3\\nn3 This grievance is not raised as a bar to the complaint.\\nThe complaint alleges that the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1) when, after allowing the Union to use the AFGE bulletin board without promulgating standards to regulate such notices, \"on or about February 3, 1998, Respondent . . . instructed &lsqb;its agent&rsqb; to remove two notices\" posted by the Union. Complaint, General Counsel&apos;s Exh. 1(c) at 2.III. Judge&apos;s Decision\\nBefore passing on the merits, the Judge considered whether the unfair labor practice (ULP) is barred by section 7116(d) of the Statute based on the Union&apos;s February 5, 1998 grievance. He stated that in order to decide whether a ULP is barred by section 7116(d), the Authority will examine the subject matter of the ULP charge to determine if both the factual predicate and legal theory are the same as raised in the grievance, citing United States Small Business Administration, Washington, D.C., 51 FLRA 413, 421 (1995).\\nThe Judge found that the original charge and the amended charge asserted the same cause of action. He stated that the original charge alleged \"the Agency instructed CCA to screen all Union messages\" and the amended charge \"added as instances of the screening, &apos;. . . and to remove two messages. . . .&apos;\" Judge&apos;s decision at 12. He further stated:Screening of messages, censorship, includes the removal of offending material as well as the rejection for posting. Consequently, the First Amended charge asserted no new cause of action but, rather, gave as specific instances of the screening, censorship, the removal of two messages.Id.\\nThe Judge found that:\\nBecause the grievance and the charge each arose from the same factual circumstances and because each asserted the same theory, namely, the screening, or censorship, of the Union&apos;s messages on the electronic bulletin board, the Complaint herein is barred, pursuant to  &lsqb;71&rsqb;16(d) of the Statute, by the prior filed grievance. n4\\nId.\\nThe Judge did not specify whether he was referring to the original charge or the amended charge. However, he found that the amended charge asserted no new cause of action\\nThe Judge stated that if the Authority should determine that the complaint alleging a ULP for removing the \"loose Cannon\" message is not barred by section 7116(d), then he would nevertheless find that, both times it was posted, the memo \"was removed because it plainly violated established Command Policy on the use of E-mail, &lsqb;and therefore&rsqb; constituted no change of established conditions of employment and did not violate &lsqb;section 7116(a)(1)&rsqb; of the Statute.\" Judge&apos;s Decision at 14.\\nThe Judge found that the April, 1997 directive establishing Agency policy on e-mail postings was in effect before the \"loose Cannon\" memos were posted, and that the messages violated the policy. The Judge stated that, while not \"lewd,\" it \"was annoying, constituted harassment and was offensive.\" Id. at 13. He also found that the description of \"a senior military officer, in the military environment of Respondent\" was derogatory, annoying, constituted harassment, \"and was offensive to Colonel Cannon, personally, and to Respondent in general.\" Id.\\nAccordingly, as the removed postings violated Agency policy, the Judge recommended dismissal of the complaint. IV. Positions of the PartiesA. General Counsel&apos;s Exception To Finding That the Complaint Is Barred By Section 7116(d)\\nThe General Counsel concedes that \"the grievance and the ULP admittedly arose from similar circumstances&lsqb;.&rsqb;\" Exceptions at 8. Nevertheless, the General Counsel contends that there are \"important distinctions that the ALJ ignored.\" Id. In addition, the General Counsel argues that even assuming that the grievance and the ULP arose from the same factual circumstances, \"they are clearly not based on the same legal theory. The grievance alleges a contract violation.\" Id. at 9. The General Counsel notes that neither the original nor the amended charge mentions the CBA, but rather relies on a theory of statutory violation. The General Counsel states that although Cooper testified she later discovered that the CBA does not explicitly cover the subject of electronic bulletin boards, the issue is not whether the grievance had merit under the theory alleged, but only whether the theory alleged in the grievance is the same as in the ULP charge.\\nThe General Counsel argues that the Judge_s framing of the theory of violation in both the grievance and the ULP as \"the screening, or censorship, of the Union&apos;s messages on the electronic bulletin board\" was incorrect. Id. at 10, quoting the Judge&apos;s decision at 12. The General Counsel continues,But \"screening or censorship\" was not the theory; it was the factual basis for the allegations. Identifying the theory of violation involves identifying the source of the right that was allegedly infringed upon. In this case, the theory in the grievance was contractual and the theory in the ULP was statutory&lsqb;.&rsqb;Exceptions at 10.B. Respondent&apos;s Opposition\\nRespondent asserts that the General Counsel overlooks \"the only plausible basis for the grievance\" in claiming that it is based on the CBA (in contrast to the ULP being based on the Statute). Respondent&apos;s Opposition at 5. Respondent claims that Cooper&apos;s admission that the CBA does not address the e-mail system or the electronic bulletin board would lead to the conclusion that the grievance is without merit, if based on the CBA. Therefore, states the Respondent, the only \"plausible basis\" for the grievance must be that \"unfettered access\" to the electronic bulletin board was established by past practice. Id. at 5-6. That, the Respondent points out, is the same theory on which the ULP charge is based.\\nThe Respondent contends that the grievant should be \"required . . . to adopt the more plausible theory\" if there are two possibilities and one of the two \"would doom a grievance to failure\" and the other would justify some sort of relief if proven. Id. at 7.C. General Counsel&apos;s Exception to the Judge&apos;s Failure to Find On the Merits that Removal of the Messages Violated the Statute\\nThe Judge determined that if the Authority should find that the complaint is not barred by section 7116(d), then the complaint regarding the \"loose Cannon\" postings should be dismissed on the merits. The General Counsel excepts to the Judge&apos;s recommendation that the allegation regarding removal of the \"loose Cannon\" posting be dismissed. The General Counsel also excepts to the Judge&apos;s failure to address and find a violation concerning the allegation about the Respondent&apos;s removal of the Partnership Council posting.\\nThe General Counsel contends that there is no evidence that the Respondent applied its policy on e-mail postings when it removed the postings. Accordingly, the General Counsel argues, an adverse inference should be drawn from the fact that the Respondent did not present evidence on why it wanted the postings removed. The General Counsel contends that the result should be a finding that the Respondent&apos;s removal of both the \"loose Cannon\" posting and the Partnership Council posting violated the Statute as alleged.D. Respondent&apos;s Opposition\\nThe Respondent argues that the assertion that it failed to apply a standard was never raised until the General Counsel&apos;s opening statement at the hearing. In addition, the Respondent notes that the postings were accessible to all employees, including military employees, and that it is responsible for \"maintaining the good order and discipline of a military organization\" as well as discharging its duties under the Statute. Opposition at 12.E. General Counsel&apos;s Exception to the Judge&apos;s Failure To Address the Allegation Regarding Removal Of the Partnership Council Posting\\nThe complaint states that \"on or about February 3, 1998, Respondent . . . removed two notices posted by AFGE, Local 900 on its AFGE bulletin board.\" General Counsel&apos;s Exh. 1(c), quoted in Exceptions at 13. The General Counsel contends that one of the \"two notices\" refers to the identical messages about Col. Cannon on that were posted and re-posted on January 29 and February 2, respectively; and that the second of the \"two notices\" refers to the Partnership Council posting.\\nThe General Counsel states,The message concerning the partnership issue was disclosed to the ALJ and to opposing counsel on November 24, 1998, as part of Counsel for the General Counsel&apos;s prehearing disclosure. In addition, at the hearing, Counsel for the General Counsel presented approximately eight transcript pages of testimony by Ms. Cooper about the posting and removal of the message on partnership with no objection from opposing counsel.Exceptions at 13. Moreover, the General Counsel asserts that it \"briefed the facts surrounding the posting and removal of this item, and argued in the brief that the removal of this item constituted a violation of section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute. Counsel for the Respondent similarly addressed this message in his post-hearing brief.\" Id.\\nThe General Counsel states that to the extent there was confusion as to whether the reference to \"two\" notices posted on the Union&apos;s electronic bulletin board meant the staffing posting, which was posted twice, or meant the staffing posting and the Partnership Council posting, \"the totality of the circumstances here should have made it clear by the time the ALJ wrote his decision that the notice concerning partnership was clearly an allegation in the case.\" Id. at 14. The General Counsel asserts that the complaint is broad enough to encompass this allegation, and the Respondent had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue at the hearing.\\nFinally, the General Counsel argues that even if the complaint is not sufficiently clear, so that the Judge misunderstood the specific allegation, \"the Authority has the power to address the issue here.\" Id. Thus, the General Counsel asserts that the Authority can address issues about which a complaint is silent or ambiguous, if the record shows that the issues were fully and fairly litigated, i.e., the respondent knew what conduct was at issue and had a fair opportunity to present a defense. In support, the General Counsel cites Bureau of Prisons, Office of Internal Affairs, Washington, D.C. and Phoenix, Arizona and Federal Correctional Institution, El Reno, Oklahoma, 52 FLRA 421, 429 (1996).F. Respondent&apos;s Opposition\\nThe Respondent argues that there is no evidence of a past practice allowing the Union to publish material that conflicts with the policy barring \"annoying, harassing, lewd or offensive material\" from the electronic bulletin board. Opposition at 10. Otherwise, the Respondent does not respond to the exception regarding the Judge&apos;s failure to address the allegation that the Respondent improperly removed the Partnership Council posting.V. Analysis and ConclusionsA. The ULP Complaint Is Not Barred By Section 7116(d)\\nConsistent with Authority precedent, \"in determining whether a ULP and a grievance involve the same issue, the Authority focuses on whether the ULP arose from the same set of factual circumstances as the grievance and whether the theories advanced in support of the ULP and the grievance are substantially similar.\" American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1917 and U.S. Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, 52 FLRA 658, 663 (1996) (AFGE Local 1917); U.S. Department of the Army, Army Finance and Accounting Center, Indianapolis, Indiana and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1411, 38 FLRA 1345, 1350-51 (1991), review denied, AFGE Local 1411 v. FLRA, 960 F.2d 176, 295 U.S. App. D.C. 117 (D.C. Cir. 1992). We conclude, for the reasons below, that the complaint is not barred by section 7116(d) because the theories advanced in support of the grievance and the ULP are different.\\nThe grievance explicitly states that the Respondent informed the Union that \"the Agency will censor it&apos;s &lsqb;sic&rsqb; Electronic Bulletin Board and remove whatever they deem necessary&lsqb;,&rsqb; in violation of Article XIII of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.\" Respondent&apos;s Exh. 2. Although the Union conceded that it was mistaken regarding the coverage of the agreement, the grievance clearly raises the CBA as its basis. The ULP Amended charge alleges that the Respondent&apos;s removal of the postings from the bulletin board violated section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute. Thus, the grievance explicitly alleged a violation of the CBA, and the basis of the ULP allegation was a violation of the Statute. Accordingly, the grievance and the ULP allegation were based on different theories. Therefore, the complaint is not barred by section 7116(d). See, e.g., U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Medical Center, North Chicago, Illinois and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2107, 52 FLRA 387, 392-93 (1996). n5 \\nn5\\nn5 In reaching this conclusion, we reject the Respondent&apos;s argument that the ULP must be barred because the only \"plausible basis\" for the grievance is the same as that advanced for the ULP. As we stated above, the grievance and the ULP were based on different theories, irrespective of whether the theory underlying the grievance lacked merit.\\nB. Removal of the \"Loose Cannon\" Memo Did Not Violate the Statute\\nIn Department of the Air Force, Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, 34 FLRA 1129, 1136 (1990) (Scott), on which the General Counsel relies to support its exceptions, the Authority stated:Where a right of access to agency property has been established by past practice &lsqb;use of the Agency newspaper, in that case&rsqb;, an employer would reasonably tend to discourage union activity in violation of section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute if: . . . (2) the employer removes union material from the employer&apos;s property where the union had been permitted to post notices and the posted material meets the employer&apos;s established standards&lsqb;.&rsqb; 34 FLRA at 1136, emphasis added. The Respondent does not dispute the appropriateness of applying Scott, opposition at 8. Consistent with this precedent, the Judge found that the Respondent did not violate section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute because the material at issue \"plainly violated established Command Policy on the use of e-mail,\" that prohibited the sending of \"annoying, harassing, lewd, or offensive material.\" Judge&apos;s Decision at 13-14 (quoting Respondent&apos;s Exh. 1, Sec. 5, Par. D(7)). The General Counsel makes only a limited challenge to this finding, asserting that the Judge erred in basing it on \"his opinion that the messages were violative of the policy,\" rather than \"evidence in the record that anyone at the Respondent actually applied the Command Policy when deciding to order CCA to remove the messages.\" GC Exceptions at 15. According to the General Counsel, an \"adverse inference should be drawn because the Respondent did not supply evidence that it, in fact, applied the policy.\" Id. The General Counsel also argues that \"the material met the Respondent&apos;s established standards.\" GC&apos;s Exceptions at 17.\\nThe General Counsel points to nothing in Scott Air Force Base, or any other precedent, that supports its assertion that the Judge erred in determining that the message, in fact, violated the Agency&apos;s established standard. The General Counsel also does not provide support for its argument that the Respondent bore the burden of establishing this factual element. Accordingly, the General Counsel has not established that the Judge erred in this regard, or provided a basis for our drawing an adverse inference from the Respondent&apos;s failure to provide evidence of its reasoning. See, U.S. Department of Commerce, Patent and Trademark Office, 54 FLRA 360, 370 (1998) (it is axiomatic that the General Counsel bears the burden of establishing each and every element of an alleged unfair labor practice in order to establish a violation of the Statute).\\nFurther, the record contradicts the General Counsel&apos;s argument that there is no evidence supporting a conclusion that the memorandum at issue did not meet the Respondents&apos; standard. In asserting that \"the evidence . . . does not support a finding that standards or a policy was ever applied,\" GC&apos;s Exceptions at 16, and that reliance on the policy by the Judge is \"after-the-fact,\" id., the General Counsel does not take into account the message that the Respondent sent to explain its actions. The February 2 message to the Union states that on January 29 a derogatory message was removed, and that subsequently another was removed for the same reason. Although \"derogatory\" messages are not explicitly included in the policy statement, the Judge explains that calling Cannon \"an insulting name, in a derogatory manner . . . was annoying, constituted harassment and was offensive&lsqb;.&rsqb;\" Judge&apos;s decision at 13.\\nIn these circumstances, we find that the General Counsel did not establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the Agency removed the material contrary to its established standards. As such, we conclude that removal of the material did not violate section 7116(a)(1). n6 Consequently, we order that this allegation of the complaint be dismissed.\\nn6\\nn6 We note that the reference to \"loose Cannon\" would likely be protected in other labor relations contexts, such as \"robust debate.\" Here, the communications had to meet the employer&apos;s standards.\\nC. The Judge Did Not Address An Allegation That Was Properly Before Him\\nOn its face the complaint&apos;s reference to the removal of \"two notices\" is ambiguous, and might refer either to the notice on staffing, which was posted twice, or to the twice-posted staffing notice as the first notice, and the Partnership Council notice as the second. For the following reasons, we conclude, in agreement with the General Counsel, that the record establishes that the alleged removal of the Partnership Council posting was litigated and should have been addressed by the Judge.\\nFirst, at the hearing, testimony by the Union included detailed reference to removal of the Partnership Council posting, as one of \"these two items&lsqb;.&rsqb;\" Tr. 35. When asked about the \"materiality\" of testimony about the Partnership Council, the General Counsel answered, \"There&apos;s an additional item that was removed from the union&apos;s electronic bulletin board and that items &lsqb;sic&rsqb; involves issues surrounding partnership and I was trying to just set the context for that.\" Id. at 28.\\nSecond, both the General Counsel and the Respondent addressed this allegation to the Judge as a separate issue. The General Counsel&apos;s brief to the Judge contains the following statement:The Respondent directed Major Mingo to remove two items from the AFGE electronic bulletin board. Cooper testified that she posted the message concerning the placement plan twice and both messages were removed, and that she posted the message concerning the Partnership Council once and that message was removed. Major Mingo testified only that he removed the two items concerning the placement plan. However, Cooper&apos;s testimony concerning the Partnership Council message indicates that that item, posted on February 2, 1998, was also removed. Mingo&apos;s cc-mail message written on February 2, 1998 indicates that he was directed to remove that message.GC&apos;s post-hearing brief at 18.\\nThe Respondent&apos;s post-hearing brief refers to both postings, in defending the ULP. It argues thatthe tone and nature of General Counsel&apos;s Exhibits 5 and 9 &lsqb;the staffing e-mail and the Partnership Council e-mail, respectively&rsqb; were such as to be harmful to the good order and discipline of . . . military personnel &lsqb;assigned to the Activity.&rsqb;Respondent&apos;s post-hearing brief at 9.\\nBased on both the testimony at the hearing and the post-hearing briefs, we conclude that the Respondent knew what was at issue, and had a fair opportunity to present a defense. In these circumstances, we find that the issue of improper removal of the Partnership Council posting was litigated, and is before the Authority.D. The Allegation Concerning the Partnership Council Posting Is Remanded To the Judge\\nWe have found that the allegation that the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1) by removing the Partnership Council posting is before the Authority. It remains to be determined whether the General Counsel has established by a preponderance of the evidence that the posting violated established agency policy. If the posting did not violate agency policy under the rule of Scott, removal where a right of access has been established would be a violation of 7116(a)(1) of the Statute because such action would reasonably tend to discourage union activity.\\nBecause the Judge did not address the allegation that the removal of the Partnership Council posting violated the Statute, the Authority does not have the benefit of the Judge&apos;s findings concerning the reason for the removal of the posting, and whether it was removed because it did not meet the Respondent&apos;s established standards. Accordingly, we remand the allegation concerning removal of the Partnership Council posting to the Judge to consider the reasons for its removal, and whether and how it was contrary to the Respondent&apos;s established standards.VI. Order\\nThe allegation that the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute when it removed the Partnership Council posting from the electronic bulletin board is remanded to the Judge to determine the reasons for its removal, and whether and how it was contrary to the Respondent&apos;s established standards.\\nThe remainder of the complaint is dismissed. Chair Phyllis N. Segal, concurring,\\nI write separately to briefly note two things. First, the charge filed by the Union alleged that the implementation of the disputed screening procedure constituted a \"change in a past practice without notification to the Union\". GC Exh. 1(a). This claim, if established, would support a violation of section 7116(a)(1) and (a)(5) of the Statute. As this claim was not litigated, however, it is not properly before the Authority for resolution. Second, the General Counsel relies in this case on the Authority&apos;s decision in Department of the Air Force, Scott Air Force Base, 34 FLRA 1129 (1990), without requesting that it be clarified or modified in any way. See GC Exceptions at 17. There is no occasion, therefore, to address whether this precedent correctly construes and applies section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute. \\nDEVANEY Before: WILLIAM B. DEVANEY\\nAdministrative Law Judge\\nDECISIONStatement of the Case\\nThis proceeding, under the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, Chapter 71 of Title 5 of the United States Code, 5 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 7101, et seq. n1, concerns whether this proceeding is barred by \\xc2\\xa7 16(d) of the Statute, the Union having filed a grievance on February 5, 1998 (Res. Exh. 2), and its initial charge herein on March 6, 1998 (G.C. Exh. 1(a)), and if it is not, whether Respondent on, or about February 3, 1998, violated \\xc2\\xa7 16(a)(1) of the Statute by ordering the removal of two notices posted by Local 900 on the AFGE electronic bulletin board.\\nn1n1 For convenience of reference, sections of the Statute hereinafter are, also, referred to without inclusion of the initial \"71\" of the statutory reference, i.e., Section 7116(a)(1) will be referred to, simply, as, \"\\xc2\\xa7 16(a)(1)\".\\nThis case was initiated by a charge filed on March 6, 1998 (G.C. Exh. 1(a)) and a First Amended Charge, filed on September 30, 1998 (G.C. Exh. 1(b)). The Complaint and Notice of Hearing issued on September 30, 1998 (G.C. Exh. 1(c)), and set the hearing for December 8, 1998. By Notice dated November 27, 1998, the parties, in this and other cases set for seriatim hearings on December 8, agreed that the hearing be rescheduled for December 10, 1998, and, pursuant thereto, a hearing was duly held on December 10, 1998, in St. Louis, Missouri, before the undersigned. All parties were represented at the hearing, were afforded full opportunity to be heard, to introduce evidence bearing on the issues involved, and were afforded the opportunity to present oral argument, which each party waived. At the conclusion of the hearing, January 11, 1999, was fixed as the date for mailing post-hearing briefs and Respondent and General Counsel each timely mailed an excellent brief, received on, or before, January 15, 1999, which have been carefully considered. On the basis of the entire record n2, including my observation of the witnesses and their demeanor, I make the following findings and conclusions:\\nn2n2 General Counsel&apos;s Motion To Correct Transcript, to which no objection was made, and which is wholly meritorious, is granted and the transcript is hereby corrected as follows:PAGELINEFROMTO441(a)-(j)(a)-(i)912G.C.

The American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 900 (hereinafter, \"Union\") is the exclusive bargaining representative of a unit of employees at Respondent (Tr. 13), which unit contains about 1100 employees, including employees of the Army Reserve Personnel Command (Tr. 13).\\n2. Respondent Army Reserve Personnel Command&apos;s automated communications is provided by Information Support Activity, ISA (Tr. 42-43). One of the automated communications systems is a cc mail system and anyone working on Respondent&apos;s premises with a valid TL account is assigned a number (password) which gives them access to the cc mail system (Tr. 43) which is more commonly called \"E-mail\" (Tr. 13, 14). In addition to E-mail, the cc mail system also contains the electronic bulletin boards of which there are a number, including one for the Union (Tr. 13). Ms. Mary C. Cooper, President of the Union since October, 1997 (Tr. 12) has a TL account (Tr. 44) and she can post messages on the Union&apos;s electronic bulletin board (Tr. 14, 43), however, she generally types, or her secretary types, a message which is sent to CCA (Centralized Customer Agency), a part of ISA, which actually does the posting (Tr. 14, 15) in five or ten minutes (Tr. 16). Ms. Cooper said that an item posted on the Union bulletin board would remain until the Union requested it be removed (Tr. 16).\\n3. On April 15, 1997, Colonel Donald G. Conway, Commander of Respondent, issued a memorandum for all personnel concerning policy on the use of the CC mail system (Res. Exh. 1; Tr. 49), Section 5 (PROCEDURES), Paragraph d. provides, in part, as follows:\"d. E-mail shall not be used for:\\n. . .\"(7) Receiving, producing or sending annoying, harassing, lewd or offensive material.. . . .\" (Res. Exh. 1, Sec. 5, Par. d(7)).\\n4. By letter dated January 12, 1998, to Colonel Conway (G.C. Exh. 2; Tr. 17), Ms. Cooper requested, \". . . to bargain over the Labor Management. . . .\" In her letter, Ms. Cooper stated that the Labor Management had expired January 1, 1998; that \"It has been brought to the attention of the Union that your subordinates are still utilizing the guidelines of this agreement\"; and then, Ms. Cooper&apos;s letter stated,\\n\"The Union request all actions as it pertains to the Agreement of the staffing plan cease until negotiations are complete.\" (G.C. Exh. 2)(Emphasis supplied).\\n5. By letter dated January 26, 1998 n3 (G.C. Exh. 3), Colonel Timothy W. Cannon, Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, Administration and Logistics, replied to Ms. Cooper&apos;s January 12, 1998, \". . . request to bargain on the expired labor/management agreement/placement plan.\" (Tr. 18). Colonel Cannon in his letter of January 26, 1998, stated, in part, as follows:\\n\"On May 29, 1997, the Commander of ARPERSCOM and the President of AFGE local 900 signed the Labor-Management Agreement, Staffing Plan, to staff the new Command. The same two parties signed an extension to this Staffing Plan on October 1, 1997, extending the provisions of the Plan until January 1, 1998. Thirty-seven employees were scheduled to be promoted to Grade GS-5 effective January 18, 1998, as part of this Plan. However, these promotions are on hold per your request for &apos;all actions as it pertains to the Agreement of the staffing plan cease until negotiations are complete.&apos; These promotions will remain in abeyance until the completion of the negotiations that the Union requested on this issue. We will also pull back the referral for seven, GS-204-7 Military Personnel Technician positions in the Records Services Directorate. We will not re-announce these positions.\\n\"I truly hope you understand the consequences that your request will have on the bargaining unit employees that you represent. First and foremost, your request will put a hold on 37, Grade GS-5 promotions mentioned above . . . Management will hold these 37 promotions until the negotiations requested by the Union are completed. Let me know by January 28, 1998, if the Union wishes to bargain Impact and Implementation of these 37 promotions as they relate to the Staffing Plan that expired January 1, 1998. In order for these employees to receive their scheduled promotion pay beginning January 18 1998, the Union&apos;s requested negotiations must be concluded January 28, 1998. If the effective date of these promotions is changed, Management will notify the employees.\\n. . . .\" (G.C. Exh. 3).\\nn3n3 Colonel Cannon stated in his letter that he had responded on January 16, 1998, by a, \". . . draft e-mail and attachment\" (G.C. Exh. 2) and that this letter of January 26, 1998, is an amended response. The text of the January 16, 1998 documents were not offered.\\n6. The original copy of Colonel Cannon&apos;s letter to Ms. Cooper was not initialed by Ms. Cooper to show receipt (G.C. Exh. 3; Tr. 21-22); but the copy employees got hold of was a copy of the copy Ms. Cooper had initialed showing that she had received it on January 27, 1998 (G.C. Exh. 4; Tr. 21), i.e., a copy of Respondent&apos;s retained copy.\\n7. Ms. Cooper retaliated on January 29, 1998, at 3:46 p.m., by a notice to all bargaining unit employees on the Union&apos;s electronic bulletin board which provided, in part, as follows:\". . . On January 28, 198, Tim &apos;LOOSE&apos; Cannon sent a letter to the Union President (SEE ATTACHED), stating that per the Union&apos;s request, he&apos;s holding all promotions until negotiations are complete.\". . . He purposely gives the impression that the Union asked to stop promotions. . . . Tim &apos;LOOSE&apos; Cannon issued copies of his letter and the Union&apos;s request to negotiate to management and employees; thereby, attempting to BUST UP THE UNION.\". . . Tim &apos;LOOSE&apos; Cannon sent me a letter via cc:mail stating that Management will proceed with the promotions of the GS-5&apos;s. He further stated that if the Union disagreed with the promotions, we could take appropriate actions. . . .\" (G.C. Exh. 5).\\n8. Ms. Cooper testified that her notice to all employees of January 29, 1998, was removed from the Union electronic bulletin board (Tr. 25). Major David Mingo, Information Support Activity &lsqb;ISA&rsqb;, Saint Louis, which supports, automation-wise, Respondent, testified that he was working late on January 29, 1998, when, at about 5:30 p.m., Major Boyd Collins, Public Affairs Officer for Respondent, came to his office and said, \". . . a message has been posted to the bulletin board that the command wants removed\" (Tr. 47; G.C. Exh. 2/2/98 Major Mingo to Union)) and, after opening up the bulletin board and identifying it, he removed the message (Tr. 47). Major Mingo stated that, \". . . I took it to mean the commander of AF-PERSCOM told him &lsqb;Major Boyd&rsqb; to go downstairs and get the message taken off the bulletin board now.\" (Tr. 48), i.e., Colonel Conaway (Tr. 48).\\n9. Ms. Cooper testified that when she was told that her January 29 notice was no longer on the bulletin board, she, on February 2, 1998, \". . . put it back out.\" (Tr. 25; G.C. Exh. 6). Except for the date and time (2/2/98; 8:53 a.m.) General Counsel Exhibit 6 is identical to General Counsel Exhibit 5 (Tr. 25, 26). Ms. Cooper stated that, \"This item &lsqb;G.C. Exh. 6&rsqb; didn&apos;t remain -- it didn&apos;t last throughout that day.\" (Tr. 26). Although General Counsel pointedly declined to ask Major Mingo whether the second message, G.C. Exh. 6, had been removed (Tr. 53), I find, as Ms. Cooper testified, it was removed and I further draw the inference from Major Mingo&apos;s message, that it had been removed before 10:41 a.m. on February 2, 1998 (G.C. Exh. 7) when his message re \"AFGE 900 Message Screening\" was sent.\\n10. Major Mingo&apos;s February 2, 1998, message which, Ms. Cooper received a copy (Tr. 26), was, as noted above, titled, \"AFGE 900 Message Screening\" and stated:\"1. 29 January 1800, MAJ Boyd Collins came to CCA and asked that a derogatory message be removed from AFGE&apos;s Bulletin board. I removed the message.\"2. I told him I would have my staff forward AFGE messages to me before posting them to the bulletin board. I neglected to inform my staff of this new requirement. . . . Today Ms Price reminded me of my commitment to MAJ Collins, and asked me to remove another derogatory message from the AFGE bulletin board.\"3. As of today myself or MSG Hill will review all AFGE messages prior to posting.\" (G.C. Exh. 7).\\n11. On February 5, 1998, Ms. Cooper, as President of the Union, filed the following grievance:\"Union Grievance RE: Censorship of the Union&apos;s Electronic Bulletin Board\"Dear Ms. Calloway:\\n\"The Union was informed in February 3, 1998 that the Agency will censor it&apos;s Electronic Bulletin Board and remove whatever they deem necessary. This is in violation of Article XIII of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.\\n\"The Union request to meet on February 12, 1998 at 1000 in your office. I have appointed James Shepherd, Ray Wilkins, and Martha Parsons (Trainee) as my designees for Union Grievances.\\n. . . . (Res. Exh. 2).\\n12. On March 6, 1998, the Union filed the charge herein n4 which reads as follows:\"On February 3, 1998 the Agency unilaterally changed a past practice without notifying this Union.\"Specifically, the Agency instructed CCA to screen all Union messages on the AFGE Bulletin ccmail account. The AFGE Bulletin has NEVER been screened before. And the Union was not notified nor provided an opportunity to bargain.\" (G.C. Exh. 1(a)).(Other than Section 7116(a)(1), the subsections alleged to have been violated are wholly unclear, the handwritten insertion being either indecipherable and/or largely non-germane).\\nn4n4 The charge is dated: 2/3/98; but was not filed until March 6, 1998 (G.C. Exh. 1(a)).\\n13. On September 30, 1998, the Union filed a First Amended charge which reads as follows:\"On February 3, 1998 the Agency unilaterally changed a post (sic) practice without notifying this Union.\"Specifically, the Agency instructed the Centralized Communications Agency (CCA) to screen all Union messages on the AFGE Bulletin cc mail account and to remove two messages from the AFGE electronic &apos;bulletin board&apos;. The AFGE Bulletin has NEVER been screened or messages on it removed before. And the Union was not notified nor provided an opportunity to bargain.\" (G.C. Exh. 1(b)).Whatever might have been alleged in the original charge, plainly the First Amended charge, as does the Complaint, alleges only a violation of \\xc2\\xa7 16(a)(1)(G.C. Exhs. 1(b); 1(c), Par. 18).\\n14. As written documents, the Union&apos;s grievance of February 5, 1998, and its charge of March 6, 1998, speak for themselves. Nevertheless, to complete the record, Ms. Cooper&apos;s statements are set forth as follows:\\nAs to the grievance:\"A . . . we did file a grievance, but it wasn&apos;t protesting the removal.\"Q Well, what was the grievance about then?\"A The last part of Major Mingo&apos;s CC message said that I and Master Sergeant somebody will censor or will screen the bulletin board. The bulletin board was covered in our contract. So the union filed a grievance saying that the agency informed us that they will screen, but we didn&apos;t file a grievance saying that they violated the contract by taking or removing our\\n. . .\"A When I filed that union grievance, that&apos;s what I thought, but the contract doesn&apos;t say anything about electronic bulletin boards. I filed the grievance, however, because it didn&apos;t say that they would remove what we put up there.\" (Tr. 39-40) (Emphasis supplied).\\n. . .\"A That they had violated our collective bargaining agreement.\" (Tr. 55)\\nAs to the charge:\"A When we filed the unfair labor practice charge, we were alleging that they were violating the statute by interfering with the union the way that we represented our employees, that they were changing the practice, that they were refusing to bargain in good faith by notifying us that they were -- by not notifying us they were removing it, that they didn&apos;t allow us the opportunity to bargain.\" (Tr. 56) (Emphasis supplied).\\n15. It is conceded that anyone with a valid TL account-bargaining unit employees, military, civilian - has access to the ccmail system, including, inter alia, the Union&apos;s bulletin board (Tr. 38, 50).ConclusionsA. The Complaint is barred by \\xc2\\xa7 16(d) of the Statute.\\n\\xc2\\xa7 16(d) of the Statute provides in pertinent part as follows:\". . . issues which can be raised under a grievance procedure may, in the discretion of the aggrieved party, be raised under the grievance procedure or as an unfair labor practice under this section, but not under both procedures.\" (5 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 7116(d)).The Authority long has made clear that:\". . . the elements of section 7116(d) which must attach in order for a grievance to be precluded &lsqb;or, conversely, for an unfair labor practice complaint to be precluded, Internal Revenue Service, Chicago, Illinois, 3 FLRA 479 (1980)&rsqb; are: (1) the issue which is the subject matter of the grievance is the same as the issue which is the subject matter of the unfair labor practice; (2) such issue was earlier raised under the unfair labor practice procedures; and (3) the selection of the unfair labor practice procedures was in the discretion of the aggrieved party. . . .\" Department of Defense Dependents Schools, Pacific Region, (hereinafter, \" DODDS, Pacific\"), 17 FLRA 1001, 1002 (1985). As succinctly stated by the Authority in DODDS, Pacific, \"Section 7116(d) effectively provides that when in the discretion of the aggrieved party, an issue has been raised under the unfair labor practice procedures, the issue subsequently may not be raised as a grievance. (17 FLRA at 1002); U.S. Department of The Army, Army Finance and Accounting Center, Indianapolis, Indiana, 38 FLRA 1345, 1350 (1991) (hereinafter, \"Army Finance\"); Olam Southwest Air Defense Sector (TAC), Point Arena Air Force Station, Point Arena, California, 51 FLRA 797, 801-802 (1996); American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1917, 52 FLRA 658, 663-664 (1996). \\nThere is no dispute that the grievance and the charge herein each arose from the same set of factual circumstances, namely, the removal, or \"censorship\", of Ms. Cooper&apos;s February 2, 1998, message from the Union electronic bulletin board at which time, Respondent at 10:41 a.m., February 2, 1998, gave the Union written notice of its action (G.C. Exh. 7). In point of fact, Ms. Cooper \"posted\" the message on Thursday, January 29, 1998, and it was removed by Respondent on January 29; when she discovered it had been removed, Ms. Cooper \"put it back\" on Monday, February 2, 1998, when it, again, was removed. \\nThe Union filed its grievance on February 5, 1998, and the Union filed the charge on March 6, 1998, so, plainly, the Union as the \"aggrieved\" party in each instance made its own free choice to file its grievance before it filed its charge-indeed, it actually prepared and signed its charge on February 3, 1998; but then \"sat on it\" for more than a month and did not file it until March 6, 1998.\\nThe grievance which the Union filed on February 5, 1998, read, as material, as follows:\"Union Grievance RE: Censorship of the Union&apos;s Electronic Bulletin Board\"Dear Ms. Calloway:\\n\"The Union was informed in February 3, 1998 that the Agency will censor it&apos;s Electronic Bulletin Board and remove whatever they deem necessary. This is in violation of Article XIII of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. . . .\" (Res. Exh. 2).\\nMs. Cooper testified,\". . . I filed the grievance . . . because it &lsqb;the Collective Bargaining Agreement&rsqb; didn&apos;t say that they would remove what we put up there.\" n5 (Tr. 40) (Emphasis supplied).The charge filed on March 6, 1998, read as follows:\"On February 3, 1998 the Agency unilaterally changed a past practice without notifying this Union.\"Specifically, the Agency instructed the CCA to screen all Union messages on the AFGE Bulletin cc mail account. The AFGE Bulletin has NEVER been screened before. And the Union was not notified nor provided an opportunity to bargain.\" (G.C. Exh. 1(a)).Ms. Cooper testified as to the charge,\". . . we were alleging that they were violating the statute by interfering with the union the way that we represented our employees, that they were changing the practice, that they were refusing to bargain in good faith by notifying us that they were -- by not notifying us they were removing it, that they didn&apos;t allow us the opportunity to bargain.\" (Tr. 56).As to the grievance, Ms. Cooper also testified that the grievance, \". . . wasn&apos;t protesting the removal\" (Tr. 40), a statement I specifically do not credit because it is discredited by and contrary to her further statement that, \". . . I filed the grievance . . . because it &lsqb;Agreement&rsqb; didn&apos;t say that they would remove what we put up there.\" In addition, the grievance itself states that, \"The Union was informed . . . that the Agency will censor it&apos;s (sic) Electronic Bulletin Board and remove whatever they deem necessary. . . .\" (Res. Exh. 2). Moreover, Ms. Cooper&apos;s statement that the grievance concerned, \"The last part of Major Mingo&apos;s cc message said that I and Master Sergeant somebody will censor or will screen the bulletin board. . . .\" (Tr. 40) is given no credence for the reasons: (a) the last sentence of Major Mingo&apos;s message of February 2, 1998, read: \"3. As of today myself or MSG Hill will review all AFGE messages prior to posting.\" (G.C. Exh. 7); (b) the only references to removal are Paragraphs 1. (dealing with the January 29 message) and 2. (dealing with the February 2 message)(G.C. Exh. 7); (c) the reference in the grievance to \". . . remove whatever they deem necessary\" and in Ms. Cooper&apos;s testimony that she filed the grievance because the Agreement, \". . . didn&apos;t say that they would remove what we put up there.\" (Tr. 40), plainly show that the grievance did, indeed, refer to the whole of Major Mingo&apos;s message of February 2, 1998, and that the grievance specifically referenced removal of \". . . what we put up there.\" (Tr. 40).\\nn5n5 To be sure, as Ms. Cooper stated, \". . . the contract doesn&apos;t say anything about electronic bulletin boards. . . .\" (Tr. 40); but, although I express no opinion as to the validity of the assertion that the provisions of Article XIII, which specifically refer only to the \"old fashioned\" display boards affixed to a wall, or displayed on an easel, extend to electronic bulletin boards, nevertheless, such interpolation and/or interpretation is by no means uncommon.\\nThe grievance and the charge each asserted censorship of the Union&apos;s electronic bulletin board. It is true that the grievance asserted that the censorship violated the parties&apos; Agreement while the charge asserted that the censorship violated the Statute. As the Authority has stated, \". . . the Authority looks at whether the ULP charge arose from the same set of factual circumstances as the grievance and the theory advanced in support of the ULP charge and the grievance are substantially similar.\" ( Army Finance, supra, 38 FLRA at 1351) (There, grievant, Acting Union Executive Vice President, received a ten day suspension for asserted offensive or abusive language. On February 11, 1988, ULP charge filed and on February 25, 1988, grievances were filed. Authority held grievances were barred by \\xc2\\xa7 16(d)).\\nIn United States Small Business Administration, Washington, D.C. &lsqb;Robert Wildberger&rsqb;, 51 FLRA 413 (1995), which involves a statutory appeal, the Authority stated, in part, as follows:\"In light of the Commerce decision, &lsqb;976 F.2d 882 (4th Cir. 1992)&rsqb; &lsqb;The Authority&apos;s decision, Bureau of The Census and Edward Hanlon, 41 FLRA 436 (1991), was vacated and remanded with directions to dismiss, which the Authority subsequently did, 46 FLRA 526 (1992)&rsqb;, we take this opportunity to clarify how the Authority will apply its Army Finance test in cases analogous to Bureau of Census I. Where an employee has attempted to raise related issues both in an unfair labor practice proceeding and under either an appeals procedure or a negotiated grievance procedure, we will apply the Army Finance test in order to determine whether to invoke the jurisdictional bars set forth in section 7116(d). We will examine the subject matter of the ULP charge to determine if the factual predicate and legal theory are the same as the matter raised in the appeals procedure or grievance.\" (51 FLRA at 421).In American Federation of Government Employees. Local 1917 and U.S. Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, 52 FLRA 658 (1996), which involved an asserted unilateral change of dress code practices, the arbitrator held that, \". . . both the grievance and the ULP involved the same allegation that the Agency had changed dress code practices for both special agents and clerical personnel. . . .\" (52 FLRA at 664), and the Authority agreed, stating, in part, \". . . it is clear that the ULP arose from the same set of factual circumstances as the grievance and the same theory was advanced in support of both the ULP and the grievance.\" (id.)\\nThe original charge alleged, \". . . the Agency instructed CCA to screen all Union messages. . . .\" (G.C. Exh. 1(a)) and the First Amended Charge added as instances of the screening, \". . . and to remove two messages. . . .\" (G.C. Exh. 1(b)). Screening of messages, censorship, includes the removal of offending material as well as the rejection for posting. Consequently, the First Amended charge asserted no new cause of action but, rather, gave as specific instances of the screening, censorship, the removal of two messages.\\nBecause the grievance and the charge each arose from the same factual circumstances and because each asserted the same theory, namely, the screening, or censorship, of the Union&apos;s messages on the electronic bulletin board, the Complaint herein is barred, pursuant to \\xc2\\xa7 16(d) of the Statute, by the prior filed grievance.B. Union message violated Policy on E-Mail use.\\nIn April, 1997, Colonel Donald G. Conaway, Respondent&apos;s Commanding Officer, issued a memorandum to all personnel re: \"Command Policy on APPERCEN &lsqb;Army Reserve Personnel Center&rsqb; E-Mail Use\" (Res. Exh. 1; Tr. 49). Colonel Conaway&apos;s Command Policy refers to Public Law 100-235, Computer Security Act of 1987; to numerous Army Regulations; a memorandum of the Assistant Secretary of Defense of December 28, 1995, entitled, \"Guidelines for Establishing and Maintaining a Department of Defense Web Information Service\"; and a Department of the Army message of October 30, 1996, entitled, \"Guidance for the Management and Operation of U.S. Army Websites, Department of the Army.\"\\nParagraph 5 d. of the Command Policy provided, in part, as follows:\\n\"d. E-mail shall not be used for:\\n. . .\"(7) Receiving, producing or sending annoying, harassing, lewd or offensive material.. . . .\" (Res. Exh. 1, Sec. 5, Par. d(7)).This policy was in effect before Ms. Cooper&apos;s message of January 29, 1998 (G.C. Exh. 5) which, after it was removed from the bulletin board by Respondent on January 29, 1998, the Union \"re-posted\" on the bulletin board on February 2, 1998. While not \"lewd\", Ms. Cooper&apos;s message plainly was annoying, harassing and offensive. For example:(i) Ms. Cooper said, in part, \"The Agency is guilty of lying . . . Specifically, the Labor-Management Agreement (Placement Plan) expired January 1, 1998. . . . The Union requested that all actions initialed after the expiration of this Agreement ceased until negotiations were completed.\" (G.C. Exhs. 5, 6) (Emphasis supplied).Ms. Cooper&apos;s representation simply was not true. She grossly misrepresented her letter of January 12, 1998, to Colonel Conaway. She might wished she had qualified her request, but this is what she said, \\n\"The Union request all actions as it pertains to the Agreement of the staffing plan cease until negotiations are complete.\" (G.C. Exh. 2) (Emphasis supplied).\\nColonel Cannon very correctly advised Ms. Cooper in his letter of January 26, 1998, that, \". . . promotions are on hold per your request for &apos;all actions as it pertains to the Agreement of the staffing plan cease until negotiations are complete.&apos;\" (G.C. Exh. 3).(ii) Ms. Cooper referred to Colonel Cannon repeatedly in a demeaning manner as \"Tim &apos;Loose&apos; Cannon\" or as \"the Loose Cannon\" (G.C. Exhs. 5, 6).Calling a senior military officer, in the military environment of Respondent, an insulting name, in a derogatory manner and to do so over and over in an E-mail message available to all personnel, military and civilian alike, was annoying, constituted harassment and was offensive to Colonel Cannon, personally, and to Respondent in general.\\nBecause Ms. Cooper&apos;s message of January 29, 1998, which she \"re-posted\" on February 2, 1998, violated Command Policy, the removal of her message on January 29 and February 2, 1998, was fully consistent with established policy and the removal constituted no change in established conditions of employment. Accordingly, if it should be determined that the Complaint is not barred by \\xc2\\xa7 16(d) of the Statute, I would, nevertheless, find that because Ms. Cooper&apos;s message of January 29, 1998, which she, \"re-posted\" on February 2, 1998, was removed because it plainly violated established Command Policy on the use of E-mail, constituted no change of established conditions of employment and did not violate \\xc2\\xa7 16(a)(1) of the Statute.\\nFor the foregoing reasons, having found that the Complaint herein is barred by \\xc2\\xa7 16(d) of the Statute; but, if it were not barred by \\xc2\\xa7 16(d), Respondent did not violate \\xc2\\xa7 16(a)(1) of the Statute, it is recommended that the Authority adopt the following:Order\\n\\n'"

In order for these employees to receive their scheduled promotion pay beginning January 18, 1998, the Union&apos;s requested negotiations must be concluded January 28, 1998.General Counsel&apos;s Exh. 3 at 1-2, Judge&apos;s decision at 4.\\nIn the words of the Judge, Ms. Cooper \"retaliated\" on January 29, 1998, Judge&apos;s Decision at 4, with a notice to all unit employees posted on the electronic bulletin board.\\nThe notice provides, in part, as follows:On January 28, 1998, Tim \"LOOSE\" Cannon sent a letter to the Union President (SEE ATTACHED), stating that per the Union&apos;s request, he&apos;s holding all promotions until negotiations are complete.He purposely gives the impression that the Union asked to stop promotions.\\nThe Union&apos;s message was removed from the electronic bulletin board by management late in the day on January 29, the same day it was posted.\\nasked that a derogatory message be removed from AFGE&apos;s Bulletin Board.\\nAs of today myself or MSG Hill will review all AFGE messages prior to posting.General Counsel&apos;s Exh. 7, Judge&apos;s decision at 5-6.\\nThe Union filed the following unfair labor practice charge on March 6, 1998:On February 3, 1998 the Agency unilaterally changed a past practice without notifying this Union.Specifically, the Agency instructed CCA to screen all Union messages on the AFGE Bulletin ccmail account.\\nOn September 20, 1998, the Union filed an amended charge, which reads as follows:On February 3, 1998 the Agency unilaterally changed a &lsqb;past&rsqb; practice without notifying this Union.Specifically, the Agency instructed the Centralized Communications Agency (CCA) to screen all Union messages on the AFGE Bulletin cc mail account and to remove two messages from the AFGE electronic \"bulletin board\".\\nAnd the Union was not notified nor provided an opportunity to bargain.General Counsel&apos;s Exh. 1(b).\\nAnd the Union was not notified nor provided an opportunity to bargain.General Counsel&apos;s Exh. 1(b).\\nOn February 2, 1998, the same day that the \"loose Cannon\" memo was re-posted (and removed), the Union posted another memo to its electronic bulletin board, this one concerning a Partnership Council issue.\\nThe posting also contained the text of a grievance filed by the Union that day, alleging violations of a specific article of the CBA that deals with partnership.\\nThe complaint alleges that the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1) when, after allowing the Union to use the AFGE bulletin board without promulgating standards to regulate such notices, \"on or about February 3, 1998, Respondent .\\nBefore passing on the merits, the Judge considered whether the unfair labor practice (ULP) is barred by section 7116(d) of the Statute based on the Union&apos;s February 5, 1998 grievance.\\nHe stated that in order to decide whether a ULP is barred by section 7116(d), the Authority will examine the subject matter of the ULP charge to determine if both the factual predicate and legal theory are the same as raised in the grievance, citing United States Small Business Administration, Washington, D.C., 51 FLRA 413, 421 (1995).\\nHe stated that the original charge alleged \"the Agency instructed CCA to screen all Union messages\" and the amended charge \"added as instances of the screening, &apos;.\\nConsequently, the First Amended charge asserted no new cause of action but, rather, gave as specific instances of the screening, censorship, the removal of two messages.Id. The Judge found that:\\nBecause the grievance and the charge each arose from the same factual circumstances and because each asserted the same theory, namely, the screening, or censorship, of the Union&apos;s messages on the electronic bulletin board, the Complaint herein is barred, pursuant to  &lsqb;71&rsqb;16(d) of the Statute, by the prior filed grievance.\\nThe Judge stated that if the Authority should determine that the complaint alleging a ULP for removing the \"loose Cannon\" message is not barred by section 7116(d), then he would nevertheless find that, both times it was posted, the memo \"was removed because it plainly violated established Command Policy on the use of E-mail, &lsqb;and therefore&rsqb; constituted no change of established conditions of employment and did not violate &lsqb;section 7116(a)(1)&rsqb; of the Statute.\" Judge&apos;s Decision at 14.\\nHe also found that the description of \"a senior military officer, in the military environment of Respondent\" was derogatory, annoying, constituted harassment, \"and was offensive to Colonel Cannon, personally, and to Respondent in general.\" Id. Accordingly, as the removed postings violated Agency policy, the Judge recommended dismissal of the complaint.\\nThe General Counsel states that although Cooper testified she later discovered that the CBA does not explicitly cover the subject of electronic bulletin boards, the issue is not whether the grievance had merit under the theory alleged, but only whether the theory alleged in the grievance is the same as in the ULP charge.\\nThe General Counsel argues that the Judge_s framing of the theory of violation in both the grievance and the ULP as \"the screening, or censorship, of the Union&apos;s messages on the electronic bulletin board\" was incorrect.\\nRespondent claims that Cooper&apos;s admission that the CBA does not address the e-mail system or the electronic bulletin board would lead to the conclusion that the grievance is without merit, if based on the CBA.\\nTherefore, states the Respondent, the only \"plausible basis\" for the grievance must be that \"unfettered access\" to the electronic bulletin board was established by past practice.\\nId. at 7.C. General Counsel&apos;s Exception to the Judge&apos;s Failure to Find On the Merits that Removal of the Messages Violated the Statute\\nThe General Counsel excepts to the Judge&apos;s recommendation that the allegation regarding removal of the \"loose Cannon\" posting be dismissed.\\nThe General Counsel also excepts to the Judge&apos;s failure to address and find a violation concerning the allegation about the Respondent&apos;s removal of the Partnership Council posting.\\nThe General Counsel contends that the result should be a finding that the Respondent&apos;s removal of both the \"loose Cannon\" posting and the Partnership Council posting violated the Statute as alleged.D. Respondent&apos;s Opposition\\nOpposition at 12.E. General Counsel&apos;s Exception to the Judge&apos;s Failure To Address the Allegation Regarding Removal Of the Partnership Council Posting\\nremoved two notices posted by AFGE, Local 900 on its AFGE bulletin board.\" General Counsel&apos;s Exh. 1(c), quoted in Exceptions at 13.\\nCounsel for the Respondent similarly addressed this message in his post-hearing brief.\" Id. The General Counsel states that to the extent there was confusion as to whether the reference to \"two\" notices posted on the Union&apos;s electronic bulletin board meant the staffing posting, which was posted twice, or meant the staffing posting and the Partnership Council posting, \"the totality of the circumstances here should have made it clear by the time the ALJ wrote his decision that the notice concerning partnership was clearly an allegation in the case.\" Id. at 14.\\nThe Respondent argues that there is no evidence of a past practice allowing the Union to publish material that conflicts with the policy barring \"annoying, harassing, lewd or offensive material\" from the electronic bulletin board.\\nThe grievance explicitly states that the Respondent informed the Union that \"the Agency will censor it&apos;s &lsqb;sic&rsqb; Electronic Bulletin Board and remove whatever they deem necessary&lsqb;,&rsqb; in violation of Article XIII of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.\" Respondent&apos;s Exh. 2.\\nThe ULP Amended charge alleges that the Respondent&apos;s removal of the postings from the bulletin board violated section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute.\\nIn Department of the Air Force, Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, 34 FLRA 1129, 1136 (1990) (Scott), on which the General Counsel relies to support its exceptions, the Authority stated:Where a right of access to agency property has been established by past practice &lsqb;use of the Agency newspaper, in that case&rsqb;, an employer would reasonably tend to discourage union activity in violation of section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute if: .\\nConsistent with this precedent, the Judge found that the Respondent did not violate section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute because the material at issue \"plainly violated established Command Policy on the use of e-mail,\" that prohibited the sending of \"annoying, harassing, lewd, or offensive material.\" Judge&apos;s Decision at 13-14 (quoting Respondent&apos;s Exh. 1, Sec. 5, Par. D(7)).\\nThe General Counsel makes only a limited challenge to this finding, asserting that the Judge erred in basing it on \"his opinion that the messages were violative of the policy,\" rather than \"evidence in the record that anyone at the Respondent actually applied the Command Policy when deciding to order CCA to remove the messages.\" GC Exceptions at 15.\\nThe General Counsel points to nothing in Scott Air Force Base, or any other precedent, that supports its assertion that the Judge erred in determining that the message, in fact, violated the Agency&apos;s established standard.\\ndoes not support a finding that standards or a policy was ever applied,\" GC&apos;s Exceptions at 16, and that reliance on the policy by the Judge is \"after-the-fact,\" id., the General Counsel does not take into account the message that the Respondent sent to explain its actions.\\nFor the following reasons, we conclude, in agreement with the General Counsel, that the record establishes that the alleged removal of the Partnership Council posting was litigated and should have been addressed by the Judge.\\nWhen asked about the \"materiality\" of testimony about the Partnership Council, the General Counsel answered, \"There&apos;s an additional item that was removed from the union&apos;s electronic bulletin board and that items &lsqb;sic&rsqb; involves issues surrounding partnership and I was trying to just set the context for that.\" Id. at 28.\\nThe General Counsel&apos;s brief to the Judge contains the following statement:The Respondent directed Major Mingo to remove two items from the AFGE electronic bulletin board.\\nHowever, Cooper&apos;s testimony concerning the Partnership Council message indicates that that item, posted on February 2, 1998, was also removed.\\nWe have found that the allegation that the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1) by removing the Partnership Council posting is before the Authority.\\nBecause the Judge did not address the allegation that the removal of the Partnership Council posting violated the Statute, the Authority does not have the benefit of the Judge&apos;s findings concerning the reason for the removal of the posting, and whether it was removed because it did not meet the Respondent&apos;s established standards.\\nAccordingly, we remand the allegation concerning removal of the Partnership Council posting to the Judge to consider the reasons for its removal, and whether and how it was contrary to the Respondent&apos;s established standards.VI.\\nThe allegation that the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute when it removed the Partnership Council posting from the electronic bulletin board is remanded to the Judge to determine the reasons for its removal, and whether and how it was contrary to the Respondent&apos;s established standards.\\n2), and its initial charge herein on March 6, 1998 (G.C. Exh. 1(a)), and if it is not, whether Respondent on, or about February 3, 1998, violated \\xc2\\xa7 16(a)(1) of the Statute by ordering the removal of two notices posted by Local 900 on the AFGE electronic bulletin board.\\nCooper, President of the Union since October, 1997 (Tr. 12) has a TL account (Tr. 44) and she can post messages on the Union&apos;s electronic bulletin board (Tr. 14, 43), however, she generally types, or her secretary types, a message which is sent to CCA (Centralized Customer Agency), a part of ISA, which actually does the posting (Tr. 14, 15) in five or ten minutes (Tr. 16).\\nMs. Cooper said that an item posted on the Union bulletin board would remain until the Union requested it be removed (Tr. 16).\\n7. Ms. Cooper retaliated on January 29, 1998, at 3:46 p.m., by a notice to all bargaining unit employees on the Union&apos;s electronic bulletin board which provided, in part, as follows:\".\\nOn January 28, 198, Tim &apos;LOOSE&apos; Cannon sent a letter to the Union President (SEE ATTACHED), stating that per the Union&apos;s request, he&apos;s holding all promotions until negotiations are complete.\".\\n8. Ms. Cooper testified that her notice to all employees of January 29, 1998, was removed from the Union electronic bulletin board (Tr. 25).\\n29 January 1800, MAJ Boyd Collins came to CCA and asked that a derogatory message be removed from AFGE&apos;s Bulletin board.\\nOn February 5, 1998, Ms. Cooper, as President of the Union, filed the following grievance:\"Union Grievance RE: Censorship of the Union&apos;s Electronic Bulletin Board\"Dear Ms. Calloway:\\nOn March 6, 1998, the Union filed the charge herein n4 which reads as follows:\"On February 3, 1998 the Agency unilaterally changed a past practice without notifying this Union.\"Specifically, the Agency instructed CCA to screen all Union messages on the AFGE Bulletin ccmail account.\\nOn September 30, 1998, the Union filed a First Amended charge which reads as follows:\"On February 3, 1998 the Agency unilaterally changed a post (sic) practice without notifying this Union.\"Specifically, the Agency instructed the Centralized Communications Agency (CCA) to screen all Union messages on the AFGE Bulletin cc mail account and to remove two messages from the AFGE electronic &apos;bulletin board&apos;.\\nwe did file a grievance, but it wasn&apos;t protesting the removal.\"Q Well, what was the grievance about then?\"A The last part of Major Mingo&apos;s CC message said that I and Master Sergeant somebody will censor or will screen the bulletin board.\\nAs to the charge:\"A When we filed the unfair labor practice charge, we were alleging that they were violating the statute by interfering with the union the way that we represented our employees, that they were changing the practice, that they were refusing to bargain in good faith by notifying us that they were -- by not notifying us they were removing it, that they didn&apos;t allow us the opportunity to bargain.\" (Tr. 56) (Emphasis supplied).\\nThere is no dispute that the grievance and the charge herein each arose from the same set of factual circumstances, namely, the removal, or \"censorship\", of Ms. Cooper&apos;s February 2, 1998, message from the Union electronic bulletin board at which time, Respondent at 10:41 a.m., February 2, 1998, gave the Union written notice of its action (G.C. Exh. 7).\\nThe grievance which the Union filed on February 5, 1998, read, as material, as follows:\"Union Grievance RE: Censorship of the Union&apos;s Electronic Bulletin Board\"Dear Ms. Calloway:\\n\"The Union was informed in February 3, 1998 that the Agency will censor it&apos;s Electronic Bulletin Board and remove whatever they deem necessary.\\n\"The Union was informed in February 3, 1998 that the Agency will censor it&apos;s Electronic Bulletin Board and remove whatever they deem necessary.\\nbecause it &lsqb;the Collective Bargaining Agreement&rsqb; didn&apos;t say that they would remove what we put up there.\" n5 (Tr. 40) (Emphasis supplied).The charge filed on March 6, 1998, read as follows:\"On February 3, 1998 the Agency unilaterally changed a past practice without notifying this Union.\"Specifically, the Agency instructed the CCA to screen all Union messages on the AFGE Bulletin cc mail account.\\nwe were alleging that they were violating the statute by interfering with the union the way that we represented our employees, that they were changing the practice, that they were refusing to bargain in good faith by notifying us that they were -- by not notifying us they were removing it, that they didn&apos;t allow us the opportunity to bargain.\" (Tr. 56).As to the grievance, Ms. Cooper also testified that the grievance, \".\\nbecause it &lsqb;Agreement&rsqb; didn&apos;t say that they would remove what we put up there.\" In addition, the grievance itself states that, \"The Union was informed .\\nMoreover, Ms. Cooper&apos;s statement that the grievance concerned, \"The last part of Major Mingo&apos;s cc message said that I and Master Sergeant somebody will censor or will screen the bulletin board.\\nThe grievance and the charge each asserted censorship of the Union&apos;s electronic bulletin board.\\nBecause the grievance and the charge each arose from the same factual circumstances and because each asserted the same theory, namely, the screening, or censorship, of the Union&apos;s messages on the electronic bulletin board, the Complaint herein is barred, pursuant to \\xc2\\xa7 16(d) of the Statute, by the prior filed grievance.B. Union message violated Policy on E-Mail use.\\n1, Sec. 5, Par. d(7)).This policy was in effect before Ms. Cooper&apos;s message of January 29, 1998 (G.C. Exh. 5) which, after it was removed from the bulletin board by Respondent on January 29, 1998, the Union \"re-posted\" on the bulletin board on February 2, 1998.\\nAccordingly, if it should be determined that the Complaint is not barred by \\xc2\\xa7 16(d) of the Statute, I would, nevertheless, find that because Ms. Cooper&apos;s message of January 29, 1998, which she, \"re-posted\" on February 2, 1998, was removed because it plainly violated established Command Policy on the use of E-mail, constituted no change of established conditions of employment and did not violate \\xc2\\xa7 16(a)(1) of the Statute.'"
